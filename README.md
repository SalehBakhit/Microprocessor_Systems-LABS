# ECSE 426 - Microprocessor Systems Fall 2017
This course teaches necessary skills for building embedded processor-based systems, including the completion of a large-scale engineering project. The background knowledge taught in ECSE426 covers the basics of modern processor and system architectures, advanced use of tools such as assemblers, C compilers and debuggers in embedded systems, as well as the methods for peripherals interfacing and networking.
## COURSE AIM
	1. understand the organization and design principles behind modern microprocessor-based systems.
	2. be proficient in assembly and high-level (C language) programming for embedded systems.
	3. understand the performance impact of the embedded software, including the energy and memory-limited design techniques.
	4. know how to connect peripheral devices and networking interfaces, and how to write programs for the efficient interface use.
	5. have experience in developing a realistic embedded system solution through teamwork.
